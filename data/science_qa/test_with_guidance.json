He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.", "lecture": "People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show?

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured.

Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times.

Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there.

The table below shows some traits used to describe each kingdom.\n | Bacteria | Archaea | Protists | Fungi | Animals | Plants\nHow many cells do they have? | one | one | one or many | one or many | many | many\nDo their cells have a nucleus? | no | no | yes | yes | yes | yes\nCan their cells make food? | some species can | some species can | some species can | no | no | yes", "question_id": "test_10130", "objects": "", "scene_graph": "zebra has head <SEP> leg of zebra <SEP> zebra has leg <SEP> zebra has nose <SEP> ear of zebra <SEP> zebra has ear <SEP> head of zebra", "captions": ["a leopard cat walks through the forest with some vegetation", "a leopard leopard walking around in the forest at night", "a leopard on the ground walking", "a leopard walking through a forest at night", "this photo shows a leopard in the woods at night", "one of the large cat species is spotted", "a cat walks through a forest at night", "cat, the relict cat, is walking around", "a wild chameleon with its ears down is walking through the woods at night", "person the crocodile cat in the wild"], "scores": [32.27, 28.8, 28.69, 28.48, 28.16, 26.95, 26.06, 25.35, 23.88, 23.43]}

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show?

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other.

Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study.\nIn a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.", "lecture": "Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff.

There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\nImagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured.

The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype.

The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen.

A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible.

Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.", "lecture": "", "question_id": "test_16126", "objects": "", "scene_graph": "head of bird <SEP> kite has tail", "captions": ["bats and flying insects live in the woods in asia", "three bats in flight", "a bat flying with the sun shining on them", "four bats flying in the sky", "a group of bats in the trees", "bats flying through the sky on a sunny day", "bats", "the bats flying through the trees", "some bats flying around in the spring", "there are three bats flying around"], "scores": [32.67, 32.56, 30.16, 29.74, 29.49, 29.16, 29.12, 28.96, 28.55, 28.51]}

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff.

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Duncan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.", "lecture": "People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems.

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured.

He fully inflated ten of them to an air pressure of 13 pounds per square inch. He inflated the remaining ten to an air pressure of 10 pounds per square inch. Kamal used  to launch a ball across a football field. He measured the distance the football traveled and then launched the next ball. Kamal repeated this with all 20 balls.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating.

You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.\nIn this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.\nThe amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive.
