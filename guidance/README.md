# Guidance Generation

The various guidances can be generated using the `generate.py` script. You can use it as follows:

```bash
python generate.py --file "file_with_image_paths.json"
```

We also generated object guidaces for AOKVQA with the UniDet model apart from the DETR model currently used in `generate.py`.
